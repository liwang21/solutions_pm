## Talent Hub Referral Point Updates to Yexter Entity Type

This plugin uses a webhook that is triggered whenever a referral is created by a Yexter or a Yexter's referral is hired. When a referral is created, 10 points will be added to the Referral Points (c_referralPoints) field in the Yexter entity type. When an existing referral is hired, 25 points will be added to the Referral Points (c_referralPoints) field in the Yexter entity type. When a Yexter updates their internal mobility profile either the 1st or 2nd time, 25 points will be added to the Referral Points (c_referralPoints) field.
